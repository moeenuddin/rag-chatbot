    Chapter One: The Dress and the Door
The wedding dress still hung in Ava Pierce’s closet, sealed in plastic like a
corpse no one wanted to bury.
    She should have burned it.
    Instead, it sat there, glowing ghost-white in the sunlight that streamed
across her bedroom floor, daring her to look away. It mocked her silently, the
overpriced symbol of a promise that had shattered three weeks before the
aisle.
    She slammed the closet door shut.
    Behind her, her apartment was half-packed—boxes stacked, labels
scribbled in rushed Sharpie, and everything echoing with the kind of silence
that wasn’t peaceful. It was hollow. Final.
    She’d be gone in a month.
    If she didn’t combust before then.

    There was a knock at the door.
    Two quick taps, one long pause.
    She didn’t even need to check the peephole.
    Only one person knocked like that.
    Ava opened the door.
    Noah Delaney stood there in his usual worn gray hoodie, holding a
cardboard tray with two coffees and a paper bag that smelled like cinnamon
and regret.
    “Figured today was a donut kind of day,” he said.
    “I don’t remember declaring that.”
    “You didn’t have to.” He handed her the bag and walked past her like he
lived there. Which, honestly, he had. Practically. For ten years.
    She followed him into the kitchen, barefoot, hair wild from sleep. Or
from lying awake all night staring at the ceiling. She hadn’t decided which.
    “What kind?” she asked, peeking into the bag.
    “No idea. I panicked under pressure and grabbed three. One of them’s
jelly. One might be pumpkin spice.”
    “You hate pumpkin spice.”
    “Exactly. That one’s for you.”
    She smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes.
   Noah noticed.
   Of course he did.
   He noticed everything.

    They ate in silence at her tiny kitchen table. The chairs still squeaked
when they shifted their weight, just like they had since college. Same
apartment. Same street. Same routine.
    Except this time, she wasn’t engaged anymore.
    And this time, he was leaving.
    “I booked the flight,” he said eventually.
    She stopped mid-bite. “To Seattle?”
    He nodded.
    “When?”
    “Three weeks from Friday.”
    Ava swallowed. The donut turned to cement in her mouth.
    “Right.”
    “It's happening,” he said quietly. “I’m really doing it this time.”
    She looked down at the bag. “Yeah. You are.”
    They didn’t speak for a full minute.
    Then she looked up.
    “Do you think we’ll stay friends?”
    Noah stared at her.
    “You’re my best friend.”
    “That’s not an answer.”
    “Yes,” he said. “I think we’ll stay friends. Unless we don’t want to
anymore.”
    She nodded, then laughed softly. “Is that something people choose? Just...
not wanting to be friends?”
    He met her gaze.
    And didn’t blink.
    “I think sometimes people want more. And they’re scared of ruining what
they already have.”
    Her heart skipped.
    It wasn’t the first time they’d danced around it. The thing between them.
The electricity that flickered too hot, too often, between their casual touches
and long-held stares.
   They had almost kissed in college. Once. Drunk on bad wine and
midterms.
   They’d almost kissed the night she broke up with Ryan, sobbing in
Noah’s arms at two in the morning.
   They almost kissed last summer at the lake, when he took her hand and
didn’t let go for longer than was strictly necessary.
   Almost.
   Always almost.

    “You want to do something crazy?” she asked.
    He leaned back in the chair, eyes narrowing. “Define crazy.”
    “Like... pact-level crazy.”
    “I’m listening.”
    Ava pulled her knees up onto the seat, serious now. “What if—for the
next thirty days—we just stopped pretending?”
    “Pretending what?”
    “That there’s nothing between us.”
    The air in the room shifted.
    Noah didn’t speak.
    She continued, voice quieter. “You’re leaving. I’m... not getting married.
We’re both untethered. What if, for once, we just didn’t hold back?”
    Noah’s voice was rough. “You’re talking about—”
    “A thirty-day pact,” she said, cutting him off gently. “No regrets. No
what-ifs. Just... whatever we want to do, we do. And at the end of it, you get
on the plane. And I stay. And we don’t have to wonder anymore.”
    He stared at her like she’d set the kitchen on fire.
    “You’re serious?”
    She nodded.
    He stood. Slowly.
    Walked toward her.
    She didn’t move.
    He stopped in front of her.
    Close. Closer than they’d ever allowed before.
    His eyes dropped to her lips.
    She inhaled, sharp and shaky.
    And then—
    He leaned in.
But didn’t kiss her.
Just let their foreheads touch.
His whisper ghosted across her skin.
“Okay.”

They didn’t kiss that morning.
But they would.
Soon.
And it would break everything.
Chapter Two: Rule One – Don’t Ruin This
The next morning, Ava woke up with her heart already racing.
    Not because of what had happened.
    But because of what hadn’t.
    No kiss. No touch beyond the warmth of Noah’s forehead pressed against
hers. No explosion. Just a whisper of a yes and the knowledge that their days
together were numbered—and about to get dangerous.
    Thirty days.
    No regrets.
    What had she done?

    She made coffee but didn’t drink it.
    Fed her cat, who judged her silently.
    Then sat on the couch and stared at the blank wall where a painting used
to hang, back when she was planning to be someone’s wife and build a
Pinterest-perfect life with color-coded calendars and throw pillows.
    Now, there was only the echo of Noah’s voice in her kitchen and the
scent of cinnamon sugar still clinging to the air.
    And his words.
    Okay.

   By 10 a.m., he still hadn’t texted.
   By 10:01, she hated herself for checking.
   At 10:03, the door buzzed.

    He was standing there, same hoodie, new coffee.
    Two cups this time.
    One black. One with oat milk and vanilla, exactly how she liked it.
    “Morning,” he said like they hadn’t made a verbal bomb out of their
friendship last night.
    “Is this a date?” she asked.
    He held up the coffees. “It’s breakfast.”
    She stepped aside to let him in.
    “So... not a date.”
    He paused. “Do you want it to be?”
   She didn’t answer.
   But she smiled.
   And he grinned like that was enough.

    They sat on the floor this time, cross-legged in front of the still-boxed TV
she never finished mounting.
    He looked around at the mess of her half-moved-out life.
    “You really going to stay here after I’m gone?”
    “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I might move.”
    “To where?”
    She sipped her coffee. “Somewhere quiet. Somewhere different.
Somewhere I don’t have to be ‘the girl who got left at the altar’ every time I
walk into the grocery store.”
    “You weren’t at the altar,” he said gently.
    “I was close enough.”

   They finished their coffee in silence.
   But the air between them was loud.
   Buzzing.
   Waiting.

   “So...” he said, setting his cup down. “About the pact.”
   She raised an eyebrow. “Having second thoughts?”
   “No,” he said. “But maybe we should have rules.”
   “Rules?”
   He nodded. “Yeah. Like... guidelines. Boundaries. So we don’t
completely destroy what’s left of our lives in thirty days.”
   “Okay,” she said slowly. “Rule one?”
   “No falling in love.”
   She gave him a look. “That’s stupid.”
   “It’s practical.”
   “It’s impossible.”
   “Exactly why it should be a rule.”
   She snorted. “Okay, fine. Rule one: don’t fall in love.”
   “Rule two,” he said, “no going backward. No talking about the past.”
   “Not even that night in college?”
   “Especially not that night.”
    “Fair.” She tapped her finger on her knee. “Rule three: don’t get jealous.”
    “Oh, that’s going to go well.”
    “I mean it. If you go on a date or flirt with someone else, I don’t get to
lose my mind. And neither do you.”
    “Fine,” he said. “Rule four: thirty days. That’s it. No carrying this into
Seattle.”
    “Right. We end it at the airport.”
    He didn’t say anything to that.
    She didn’t either.
    Because ending it? That wasn’t the scary part.
    The scary part was that it might never end—once it started.

    He stood a little while later.
    Walked to the door.
    Paused.
    “You free tonight?”
    She blinked. “For what?”
    “Something reckless.”
    Ava’s heart fluttered. “Give me a time.”
    “Eight.”
    And then he was gone.

   She stood in the doorway after he left, barefoot on the cold tile, staring
down the street as his figure faded into the sunlit sidewalk.
   This was real.
   It was happening.
   She walked back into the kitchen.
   And grabbed the damn dress out of her closet.

   She didn’t burn it.
   But she stuffed it into a trash bag, tied it tight, and threw it down the
garbage chute like it never mattered.
   Because she didn’t need it anymore.
   Not if Noah was showing up at 8 p.m.
   Not if tonight was the first of thirty nights with no regrets.
    Chapter Three: We Shouldn’t Be Here
Ava changed her outfit three times.
    Not because she wanted to impress him. That’s what she told herself,
anyway.
    But because she couldn’t figure out what the hell someone was supposed
to wear for a maybe-not-a-date with the guy you’ve been in love with since
you were nineteen but have never once kissed.
    She finally settled on her favorite jeans and the deep green sweater he
once told her made her eyes look like “you swallowed a forest.” Then
immediately wondered if that was trying too hard.
    When she opened her door at 7:59, Noah stood there holding... a
blindfold.
    She blinked. “Am I being kidnapped?”
    He grinned. “You said something reckless.”
    “That’s... not a no.”
    “Trust me?”
    She narrowed her eyes but stepped back and let him in. “You didn’t
answer the question.”
    “I didn’t think I had to.”
    She held out her hand. “Give me the blindfold.”
    He lifted an eyebrow. “You’re just going to—?”
    “Put it on me before I change my mind.”
    He did, gently, tying the soft fabric behind her head. She could feel his
fingers brushing her hair, the warmth of his breath against her ear.
    Her heart was pounding again.
    Great.
    They hadn’t even left the apartment yet.

    The ride was full of music and silence, alternating in careful, cautious
bursts. Ava didn’t speak. Neither did Noah. He just drove, the hum of the
engine blending with her racing thoughts.
    He helped her out of the car, guided her by the hand across gravel, then
grass. She heard a distant ripple of water. Crickets.
    Night.
    Cool air.
   Familiar smells.
   “You brought me to the lake,” she said quietly.
   “Maybe.”
   “You really think this is a good idea?”
   “No.”
   “You’re doing it anyway.”
   “Yep.”

    When the blindfold came off, her breath caught.
    The dock stretched out over still black water, stars reflecting off the
surface like tiny, trembling secrets. A blanket lay at the end of the dock, a
bottle of wine resting beside it, two glasses, and her favorite bag of salt-and-
vinegar chips.
    She turned to him.
    “Noah.”
    He shrugged. “We always said we’d do this. One night. Just us. No one
else.”
    “We were sixteen.”
    “Still counts.”
    They sat down side by side, legs dangling off the dock, feet hovering
above the water.
    He poured the wine.
    Passed her a glass.
    They drank in silence for a while.

    Ava leaned back on her elbows, letting her hair fall over her shoulders.
“This feels like the part in a movie where the guy leans in and kisses the
girl.”
    Noah didn’t move.
    “So why don’t we?” she asked.
    He turned, looked at her.
    Really looked.
    “Because we’re not in a movie,” he said. “And if I kiss you, I won’t be
able to stop.”
    She smiled, sad and slow.
    “I think you’ve already started.”
    He kissed her.
    Finally.
    Soft and sure, like he’d been holding back for years.
    Which, of course, he had.
    Her hands slid into his hoodie. His fingers tangled in her hair. And when
they pulled apart, the night felt different. Warmer. Wilder. Like something had
broken free.
    They didn’t speak.
    Didn’t need to.
    But something shifted after that.
    An awareness.
    A line had been crossed.
    And there was no going back.

    They lay on the blanket afterward, side by side, her head on his shoulder,
the stars flickering overhead like they’d been waiting for this too.
    “No regrets?” he asked softly.
    She didn’t answer right away.
    Then: “Not yet.”

   They didn’t kiss again when he walked her to her door.
   Didn’t touch.
   But when she turned the key in the lock, he stopped her.
   “Tomorrow,” he said. “Lunch. I’m stealing you.”
   “Where?”
   “You’ll see.”
   She smiled. “Still not a date?”
   “No,” he said. “It’s worse.”
   She laughed. “What’s worse than a date?”
   He leaned in, eyes dark with something deeper.
   “A possibility.”
   Chapter Four: Just Pretend It’s Normal
Ava was late.
     Not by much—just seven minutes. But it was enough to make her panic a
little. Enough to make her wonder if showing up would make this all too
real. She’d kissed her best friend last night. Actually kissed him. On a dock.
Under stars. With wine.
     And it wasn’t a maybe.
     It wasn’t an almost.
     It was.
     And now she had to see him again. In daylight.
     No dream logic. No midnight softness. Just the two of them and whatever
the hell this was becoming.

    Noah was already sitting at their usual table when she walked into the
café. Corner booth, one side of the vinyl peeling, their initials carved into the
tabletop like a secret they hadn’t even admitted to themselves when they
were eighteen.
    He looked up as the bell over the door jingled.
    Smiled.
    That damn Noah Delaney smile—half trouble, half I told you this would
happen.
    She slid into the seat across from him and dropped her purse with a thud.
    “I panicked and changed my outfit three times.”
    “I know.”
    She blinked. “How?”
    “You always show up in black when you’re nervous.”
    She looked down at herself.
    Black jeans. Black turtleneck.
    Dammit.
    “Coffee’s already ordered,” he said. “Hazelnut, almond milk, no sugar.”
    “You trying to seduce me?”
    He lifted an eyebrow. “Is it working?”
    She looked away, fighting a grin. “Maybe.”

   Their food arrived—pancakes for her, eggs and bacon for him.
    They ate in comfortable silence, the hum of the café wrapping around
them like background music to something bigger. Something unspoken.
    Ava stabbed a bite of pancake and said, “So what are we doing,
exactly?”
    Noah didn’t look up. “Breakfast.”
    “I’m serious.”
    “I know.”
    He finally looked at her, expression softer now. “We’re... trying. We’re
figuring it out. We’re letting the clock run and seeing what happens.”
    She sipped her coffee. “That’s vague.”
    “That’s safe.”

    After breakfast, they walked down Main Street, passing shops they used
to sneak into after school, alleys they once dared each other to run through,
and the bookstore where they’d both spent a summer pretending to work and
actually just reading romance novels in the stockroom.
    They stopped at a bench near the park.
    “You remember when you almost kissed me here?” she asked.
    He looked at her sideways. “Which time?”
    She laughed. “Fair.”
    “You had just cried watching E.T. in the movie-in-the-park thing. You
were wearing that ridiculous sweatshirt with the glitter alien.”
    “I loved that sweatshirt.”
    “You looked like a drunk disco ball.”
    “And you loved it.”
    “I loved you in it,” he said, too quiet.
    The air shifted.
    She turned to face him.
    “Noah...”
    “I know,” he said, smiling faintly. “We’re not supposed to say that stuff.”
    “Especially in broad daylight.”
    “Especially before lunch.”
    She bumped his shoulder with hers. “We’re really bad at this, you know.”
    “At what?”
    “Being casual.”
    He exhaled a laugh. “Yeah. We are.”
    They ended up back at her place by midafternoon.
    He helped her sort through old boxes she didn’t have the heart to open
alone—photos of her and Ryan, RSVP cards never mailed, a handwritten
schedule with flower deliveries and vow drafts scribbled on the margins.
    “Do you want to throw it all away?” he asked gently.
    She stared at the mess. “No.”
    He looked surprised.
    “I want to remember what I thought I was building,” she said. “So I can
build something better next time.”
    His eyes softened. “You will.”
    “I might already be trying.”
    The silence stretched.
    He stepped closer.
    She could smell his cologne—cedar and clean laundry and something
him.
    Their eyes met.
    She reached up, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.
    He didn’t move.
    They stood like that for too long.
    Then he said, “We should stop.”
    “I know.”
    But neither of them moved.

    Later, they sat on the floor with beers and a half-eaten pizza, the boxes
around them like ruins of a former life.
    “Rule number five,” she said suddenly.
    Noah looked over at her. “Oh? We’re adding rules now?”
    She nodded. “Yeah. We have to.”
    “What is it?”
    She looked him dead in the eye.
    “No disappearing.”
    He blinked. “What?”
    “When this ends—when the thirty days are up—you don’t just ghost me.
No vanishing into your new job. No fake forgetting. You stay. Even if it’s just
on the phone.”
    He stared at her.
    Then nodded.
“Okay.”
“I’m serious, Noah.”
“I know.”
She leaned her head on his shoulder.
He leaned his cheek against her hair.
And for a moment, it felt normal.
Almost.
Chapter Five: Red Lights and Green Flags
The next Friday night, Ava and Noah found themselves at the one place
neither had visited since high school:
    Stoney’s Drive-In.
    It was a retro mess of neon signs, crumbling concrete, and teenage drama.
Couples made out in pickup trucks. Kids passed flasks behind minivans. The
audio crackled through tinny speakers and the popcorn was always slightly
stale—but none of that mattered.
    It was their spot.
    Back then, anyway.
    Back when they were just a girl and a boy sitting on the roof of a Civic,
pretending they didn’t want to touch each other.
    Tonight, they were in his car, and they were very much not pretending.

    “You sure you want to do this?” Ava asked as the previews rolled.
    “I want to relive your most embarrassing high school moment.”
    “Ugh. I knew you remembered.”
    “You mean the part where you tripped over your own feet and spilled
Cherry Coke on Jared Langley’s lap?”
    “I meant the part where I told him I liked him after.”
    “Oh yeah. That was brutal.”
    She groaned and buried her face in her hands.
    Noah laughed and handed her a cup of soda. “You want to go? We can
leave.”
    “No,” she said, taking a sip. “I want to overwrite the memory.”
    “Then we better make out.”
    She choked on the soda.
    He grinned.
    “Kidding,” he said. Then quieter: “Unless you’re not.”

    By the middle of the movie, neither of them remembered what they were
watching.
    They sat shoulder to shoulder, her head resting lightly against his. It was
cozy. Intimate. But somehow still tentative, like their bodies remembered the
rules they’d followed for years even if their hearts didn’t.
   His hand found hers.
   She laced their fingers together without looking down.
   They stayed like that for a long time.

   After the movie, they didn’t go home.
   Instead, they drove aimlessly through the city, windows down, music too
loud, singing old songs off-key. It was reckless and soft and everything she
hadn’t known she needed.
   At a red light, she turned to him.
   “I thought you were going to leave last year.”
   He looked over. “I almost did.”
   “Why didn’t you?”
   The light changed.
   He didn’t move.
   “I couldn’t leave you.”
   The silence stretched.
   Then he drove forward like nothing had been said.

    They ended up parked at Overlook Point—where you could see the
whole city glitter beneath the stars.
    She climbed onto the hood of his car and he followed, both of them
laying back, side by side, looking up.
    “How are we going to survive the end of this?” she asked softly.
    “I don’t know.”
    “What if we don’t?”
    “Then we don’t.”
    She turned her head toward him. “That’s not comforting.”
    “It’s honest.”
    Her voice cracked. “I hate honesty.”
    “Then I’ll lie.”
    He looked at her. “We’re going to be fine.”
    She smiled, tears threatening. “Better.”

   They didn’t kiss that night.
   But they held hands the entire way home.

   The next morning, she woke to a text from him.
Noah:
Reminder: No disappearing.
Also, you sing like a dying goose.
Still kind of love it though.
She stared at her screen for a full minute before typing back:
Ava:
Don’t fall in love with me.
Noah:
Too late.

She put down her phone.
And cried into her pillow for exactly five minutes.
Then she made coffee.
And crossed off day five on her calendar.
          Chapter Six: It Was Always You
Ava had a dream about him.
    Not the kind you could brush off, not something vague and fleeting. It was
the kind that woke her at 3:12 a.m. breathless, heart hammering, body tangled
in sheets and sweat.
    In the dream, they were back in high school.
    Locker-lined hallways. Dimmed gym lights. The winter dance.
    He’d leaned in.
    Kissed her.
    And she hadn’t pulled away.
    Not even once.

    The next morning, Ava couldn’t shake it.
    Even while brushing her teeth. Even while picking out a sweater that
wasn’t trying too hard (but also definitely was). Even when she burned her
toast.
    Especially not when Noah texted:
    Noah:
    I’m outside. Bring running shoes.
    Not joking.

     They hadn’t been on the hiking trail since her twenty-fifth birthday, when
she’d twisted her ankle halfway up the bluff and Noah had carried her back
to the car while she laughed through the pain.
     She remembered the weight of his arms. His heartbeat in her ear.
     Today, the weather was perfect. Blue sky. Cool air. Sunlight filtering
through leaves like gold.
     “Didn’t peg you for a sunrise hike kind of guy,” she said as they hit the
dirt trail.
     He handed her a granola bar. “I like the silence.”
     “You hate silence.”
     He glanced sideways. “Not when it’s with you.”
     She looked away, blushing.

   Halfway up, they stopped for water.
    Ava leaned on a rock, catching her breath.
    “You remember the last time we did this?” she asked.
    He grinned. “You swore at a squirrel.”
    “It lunged.”
    “You said it had death in its eyes.”
    “It did.”
    He laughed.
    She smiled, watching him.
    And said it before she could stop herself.
    “I think I’ve been in love with you for years.”
    The words floated into the air.
    Unstoppable. Raw.
    He didn’t say anything.
    Just watched her.
    Then: “I know.”
    Her chest tightened. “How long?”
    “A long time,” he said. “Maybe since the day you brought me a cupcake
on the anniversary of my mom’s death. And didn’t say a word.”
    They stood in the sun, letting the truth settle between them.
    “You think this ends in heartbreak?” she asked.
    “Probably.”
    “But we’re still doing it.”
    “Absolutely.”

   At the top of the bluff, the view was everything it used to be.
   Endless sky.
   Endless possibility.
   She stood at the edge, wind in her hair, and he stepped behind her, arms
loose around her waist.
   She leaned into him.
   Closed her eyes.
   And whispered, “Don’t let go.”
   “I won’t,” he said.
   But they both knew one of them would have to.

   That night, he stayed over.
   No sex.
Just the couch.
Just the comfort of sleeping inches apart.
His fingers curled around hers beneath the blanket.
And just before sleep took her, she whispered into the dark:
“If this was the end of the world, I’d still pick you.”
He didn’t respond.
But she felt his thumb brush the back of her hand.
Like a promise.
 Chapter Seven: Rules Are Just Guidelines
Ava woke to the smell of toast and the sound of Noah singing badly in the
kitchen.
    “Your body is a wonderlaaaand—”
    crash
    She smiled before her eyes were even fully open.
    Padding into the kitchen, she found him in boxer shorts and one of her old
college sweatshirts, wielding a spatula like it was a weapon and burning
scrambled eggs with enthusiasm.
    “You’re a menace,” she said, leaning against the doorframe.
    He turned, grinning, unapologetic. “Breakfast in bed. It was going to be
romantic.”
    “And instead, it’s a fire hazard.”
    He shrugged. “Worth it if you smiled.”
    She tried not to.
    Failed.

    They sat cross-legged on her bed, eating slightly burnt toast and cold eggs
off mismatched plates.
    It felt easy.
    Too easy.
    “Have you told your mom yet?” she asked.
    Noah blinked. “About... what?”
    “The job. The move.”
    He hesitated. “No.”
    “Why?”
    He chewed. Swallowed. “Because if I say it out loud, it becomes real.”
    “It is real.”
    He didn’t answer.
    Just handed her the last piece of toast.

    Later that day, they wandered downtown and ended up at the record store
they used to haunt in college. Ava flipped through bins while Noah hovered
near the speakers, nodding like a music snob.
   She found an old Joni Mitchell album and held it up. “Remember when
we made out to this on your dorm floor?”
   He laughed. “We almost made out.”
   “Right.” She smirked. “Almost.”
   They stood there, still holding the record between them.
   Neither moved.
   The word almost hung in the air like dust in sunlight.
   Then he leaned in.
   Kissed her again.
   In the middle of the store.
   Right between Classic Rock and Jazz.
   No hesitation.
   No apology.
   Just lips, hands, her back pressed into the wall of vinyl.
   Her fingers tangled in his hair.
   And just like that, another line blurred.

    Back in the car, she stared out the window.
    “You realize we’ve broken, like, three of our rules already,” she said.
    “Rules are just guidelines.”
    “That’s not what you said when I almost made you get a tattoo in
college.”
    He laughed. “I still have the scar.”
    “It was temporary!”
    “It was a needle.”
    “You were being dramatic.”
    He reached over and laced their fingers together.
    “Say it again,” he said quietly.
    “What?”
    “That you love me.”
    She blinked, caught off guard.
    “You remember that?”
    “I remember everything.”
    She looked at him.
    And said it again.
    “I love you.”
   And when he smiled, she believed—just for a moment—that thirty days
could be enough.

   That night, she wrote the words down in her journal.
   I love him.
   I’ve always loved him.
   And I don’t know how to let him go.
   Then she crossed out the last line.
   Because maybe she wouldn’t have to.
   Maybe.
          Chapter Eight: Borrowed Time
Noah’s hand found hers beneath the diner table.
    It was subtle—fingers brushing against hers while they talked about
nothing. What to order. Whether the fries were better than the onion rings.
Why the table still wobbled even after twenty years of chewing gum under
the leg.
    It should’ve felt casual.
    It didn’t.
    Every little touch now buzzed with weight. With questions. With what
happens when the clock runs out?

   The waitress brought their food and gave them that too-knowing look.
   “You two make a cute couple.”
   Ava smiled. Noah did too.
   But she didn’t correct her.
   She didn’t say we’re not.
   Because what were they, really?
   A promise with an expiration date.

    Later, they walked to the riverwalk where the town’s July Fourth
fireworks used to be.
    They sat on the railing, feet dangling over the water, eating soft serve.
Noah had strawberry. Ava had chocolate with rainbow sprinkles. He always
said it made her look like a five-year-old. She always said it made her
happy.
    “Do you ever think about the first time?” she asked suddenly.
    He looked over. “The first what?”
    “Time we almost kissed.”
    He laughed. “Which one?”
    “The real first one.”
    His eyes softened. “Yeah. You were drunk. I wasn’t. You were crying
about your parents.”
    “And you said, ‘Don’t kiss me unless you mean it.’”
    He nodded. “And you didn’t.”
    “I wanted to.”
   He turned to her. “Then why didn’t you?”
   “Because I would’ve meant it.”

   They sat in silence after that.
   The kind of silence where everything important has already been said.

   That night, he stayed again.
   They lay on the couch watching bad reality TV, half under a blanket, her
head on his chest.
   She could feel the rhythm of his heartbeat.
   Slow.
   Safe.
   Strong.

   Around midnight, she whispered, “What if thirty days isn’t enough?”
   He didn’t answer right away.
   Then: “What if it has to be?”
   Her eyes welled. She nodded.
   Because she’d known that.
   She’d always known.
   But it still hurt like hell to hear it out loud.

   When she fell asleep, she dreamt of missing flights and locked doors.
   And waking up alone.
  Chapter Nine: The Things We Don’t Say
Ava stood in front of her mirror, holding up two dresses and judging herself
more than the outfits.
    “This is a mistake,” she muttered to the cat perched on her dresser.
    The cat, wholly uninterested, blinked once and yawned.
    She tossed both dresses onto the bed and pulled on jeans and a tank top
instead. Less romantic. More casual. Easier to pretend nothing mattered
when you weren’t dressed like everything did.
    Tonight wasn’t supposed to be a thing.
    Except it kind of was.
    Noah had invited her to his sister’s engagement party.
    And for the first time in a long time, Ava Pierce was walking into a room
not as someone’s fiancée—but as someone’s maybe.
    That terrified her.
    Almost as much as it thrilled her.

    The party was at a rooftop bar—string lights, laughter, champagne in
flutes, and a soundtrack of soft jazz and loud voices.
    Ava spotted him instantly.
    Dark jeans, button-down shirt rolled at the sleeves, one hand in his
pocket like he was already halfway out the door.
    But when he saw her, he lit up.
    Actually lit up.
    As if she was the reason he’d come at all.
    And maybe she was.

   Noah crossed the space between them in three easy strides.
   “You look good,” he said.
   She raised an eyebrow. “That was almost a compliment.”
   He grinned. “You look like trouble.”
   “Much better.”

   The night unfolded in snapshots:
   • Noah introducing her as “Ava, my best friend—who is also terrifyingly
competitive at karaoke.”
    • His sister pulling her aside and whispering, “You know you’re the
reason he never dated anyone else seriously, right?”
    • Dancing with him under too-warm lights, his hand splayed across her
lower back, her fingers curled in his collar.
    No one asked if they were together.
    No one had to.
    They moved like a pair of magnets—always pulling, always circling.
    Even when they tried not to.

    At one point, she stepped outside alone, leaning against the railing to
breathe.
    The city glittered below. Wind tangled her hair.
    She closed her eyes.
    “You okay?” His voice was behind her.
    She nodded. “Just needed a second.”
    Noah joined her at the railing.
    Close. Too close.
    He didn’t say anything.
    Neither did she.
    Until—
    “My mom asked about the wedding yesterday,” she said. “I didn’t tell her
it was off.”
    He glanced sideways. “Why not?”
    “I think I’m still figuring out how to say I chose myself this time.”
    “That’s brave,” he said.
    “It doesn’t feel like it.”
    He reached over. Took her hand.
    “You’re allowed to be scared,” he said. “You just don’t get to run
anymore.”
    She looked up at him.
    “Neither do you.”

   They kissed again.
   Softer this time.
   Less heat, more ache.
   Like they were memorizing the shape of what they might lose.
   They left the party early, neither of them ready to let the night go, and
ended up back at his apartment for the first time in months.
   She stood in his bedroom doorway.
   He stood across the room, watching her.
   Her voice shook. “I don’t want to stop.”
   He stepped toward her. “Then don’t.”
   She reached for his shirt.
   And he let her.

    They didn’t make love that night.
    They didn’t undress.
    They didn’t cross that final line.
    But when they fell asleep wrapped around each other, it felt like the start
of something they couldn’t name.
    Something terrifying.
    Something sacred.
       Chapter Ten: The Line We Crossed
Ava woke before the sun.
     It was still dark outside, the kind of quiet that only exists in those slivers
of time where nothing is expected of you yet.
     Noah’s arm was around her waist.
     His breathing, steady.
     His warmth, all-consuming.
     For a moment, she didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just existed in that perfect
stillness where everything felt right and none of it felt borrowed.
     But then the clock ticked—audible, cruel—and reminded her: they were
on a countdown.
     And she had no idea what day they were on anymore.
     Only that it felt closer to the end than the beginning.

    He stirred beside her.
    Eyes opening slowly.
    “Morning,” he mumbled, voice thick with sleep.
    “Hi.”
    Neither moved.
    She traced a line along the edge of his forearm, skin to skin, slow and
uncertain.
    “I had a dream,” he said.
    “Yeah?”
    “You moved to Seattle.”
    Her breath caught.
    “In the dream, you got off the plane and found me waiting in baggage
claim.”
    She smiled faintly. “That’s a very romantic place for a reunion.”
    “Well, it was better than the first version where I missed the flight
entirely and you ended up dating the gate agent.”
    She laughed. “I do have a thing for guys in uniforms.”
    “Duly noted. Never flying again.”

   Later that morning, Ava made them both coffee, stealing one of Noah’s
hoodies and listening to him pretend not to stare while she moved through his
kitchen like she belonged there.
    Because, in so many ways, she did.
    She had since they were seventeen.

   By afternoon, they were walking through their old college campus, just
because. The trees were taller now. The library smelled the same. And
someone had finally repainted the peeling mural over the art building.
   She reached for his hand without thinking.
   He took it.
   Didn’t let go.

     They sat on the quad’s concrete steps as clouds rolled in, the air suddenly
cool.
     “I used to wonder,” Ava said, “if you ever thought about it.”
     Noah leaned back on his elbows. “About what?”
     “Us. Being something more.”
     He glanced at her, lips quirking. “You think I didn’t?”
     “I didn’t know.”
     “I thought about it every damn time you kissed someone else.”
     She blinked. “You were jealous?”
     “I was human.”
     Her heart twisted.
     “Then why didn’t you ever—?”
     “Because I was scared,” he said simply. “Scared that if I told you how I
felt and you didn’t feel it back, I’d lose you completely. And I’d rather love
you from a distance than risk not having you in my life at all.”
     Tears stung her eyes before she could blink them back.
     She leaned her head on his shoulder.
     “I wish I’d known.”
     “I think we both did,” he said. “We just weren’t ready to say it.”

    That night, Ava made dinner at her place—nothing fancy, just pasta and
garlic bread and a bottle of wine they didn’t even finish.
    Noah stayed late.
    Too late.
    And when she walked him to the door, they paused there—like always.
    Hovering between choices.
    Ava’s voice was soft. “You could stay.”
    He swallowed. “I don’t think I should.”
    “I know.”
    But neither of them stepped away.
    Finally, he leaned in.
    Kissed her.
    Long.
    Deep.
    Full of everything they hadn’t said and everything they still couldn’t
promise.
    When he pulled back, he rested his forehead against hers.
    “We’re not just crossing lines anymore, Ava,” he whispered. “We’re
erasing them.”
    She nodded.
    Because it was true.
    They weren’t dancing near the edge.
    They were falling.
    And they were running out of time.
 Chapter Eleven: What If It’s Already Too
                  Late
Rain was falling sideways by morning.
    Not gentle, poetic rain.
    But violent, sideways, ruin-your-hair-and-make-you-question-your-
life-choices kind of rain.
    Ava stood inside the coffee shop, dripping, her fingers wrapped tightly
around her cup like it was the only source of warmth in the world.
    Noah was late.
    Which wasn’t unusual.
    But it was day seventeen of their thirty-day pact.
    And suddenly everything felt heavier. Louder. Like time was running
downhill and they were both sprinting to catch it before it crashed.
    She glanced at the door again.
    Still no Noah.

    When he finally arrived—drenched, breathless, smiling—she nearly
cried.
    Not from anger.
    From relief.
    From realizing how quickly something can matter more than you’re
prepared for.
    “I brought muffins,” he said, holding up a brown paper bag.
    “I don’t care,” she whispered. “You’re here.”
    He blinked at her.
    Something in her tone.
    Something that sounded suspiciously like fear.

    They sat in the back corner booth, away from the windows.
    “I have to tell you something,” she said before he’d even unzipped his
jacket.
    He stilled. “Okay.”
    “It’s nothing bad. It’s just—hard.”
    He waited.
She took a deep breath.
“My ex called me yesterday.”
Noah didn’t react. Not visibly.
“And?”
“He said he made a mistake. That he wants to talk.”
Silence.
Long and sharp.
“Do you want to talk?” Noah finally asked.
She shook her head. “No. I told him I was seeing someone.”
His eyes searched hers. “You told him about us?”
“I told him about you.”

Noah looked away.
Not angry.
Just... distant.
“Okay,” he said.
“That’s not all.”
She reached into her bag and pulled out a sealed envelope.
Laid it on the table.
He stared at it.
“What’s this?”
“I applied for a job,” she said. “In Seattle.”
He looked up.
Fast.
Eyes wide.
“You’re kidding.”
“I’m not.”
He picked up the envelope. “Did you get it?”
“I don’t know yet.”
“You did, didn’t you?”
She didn’t answer.
But her silence spoke.

Outside, the rain kept falling.
Inside, they sat in a silence they didn’t know how to name.
    Later, in his car, she said, “I didn’t tell you because I was trying to
surprise you.”
    He nodded.
    Still quiet.
    “I didn’t want this to end in a goodbye,” she said. “I wanted to be brave.”
    “You are,” he said, finally looking at her. “But you also should’ve told
me.”
    “I know.”
    He exhaled. “I just—I didn’t expect to fall for you like this, Ava. Not
again. Not so hard.”
    Her voice cracked. “I didn’t expect any of it.”
    They sat in the dark for a long time.
    Then he leaned across the console.
    Kissed her.
    Soft. Careful. Like the start of a second chance.

    When she got home that night, she crossed off another square on her
calendar.
    Thirteen days left.
    And her heart already didn’t know what to do with the idea of being
apart.
   Chapter Twelve: When We Pretend It’s
                 Forever
Twelve days left.
    It was a number Ava couldn’t stop whispering to herself—on the bus, in
the mirror, while brushing her teeth. She said it like it might make the clock
slow down.
    It didn’t.
    Noah didn’t bring it up either.
    Not directly.
    But it was everywhere now—in the way he touched her a little longer
than necessary, held her hand like it might vanish, kissed her like he didn’t
want to come up for air.

   They spent the day pretending.
   Pretending they weren’t running out of time. Pretending their lives
weren’t splintering into two separate directions.
   Pretending they weren’t in love.
   And maybe that’s why it felt so perfect.

   Noah took her to the farmer’s market. They sampled cheeses they
couldn’t pronounce, bought strawberries just to eat them while walking, and
spent twenty minutes debating whether or not succulents could feel emotions.
   “They’re basically cacti,” he argued.
   “And you’re basically heartless,” she countered, cradling a tiny pot in her
hands.
   He reached over, tapped her nose. “I dare you to name it after me.”
   “Please. This thing will survive anything. I’m naming it after your
emotional resilience.”
   “Rude.”

   They ended up at his place that night.
   Not because of a plan.
   Because it was easier than saying goodbye.
     She sat on his kitchen counter in one of his old shirts, sipping wine from
a mug that read “World’s Okayest Roommate.”
     He cooked pasta, humming a song she didn’t recognize.
     She watched him like she wanted to memorize it—this moment, this
version of them, this version of him.
     “Can I ask you something?” she said.
     He turned down the stove.
     “Anything.”
     “If I hadn’t made the pact—if I hadn’t said anything that night—would we
still be here?”
     He walked to her.
     Stood between her legs, hands resting on her thighs.
     He didn’t smile.
     Didn’t look away.
     “We were always going to be here, Ava. You just gave us permission.”

   They ate curled up on the couch, bowls in their laps, legs tangled.
   She told him about the job offer. All of it.
   Not just the what, but the why.
   How it scared her. How it thrilled her. How she didn’t know what she
was chasing anymore, only that it had to be hers.
   He listened.
   Like he always did.
   And when she finished, he kissed her temple.
   “You’re going to be brilliant.”
   “I’m going to be lonely.”
   “You’ll have me.”
   “You’ll be across the country.”
   “You’ll still have me,” he said.
   Like a promise.
   Like a vow.

   That night, they made love for the first time.
   No rush.
   No panic.
   No pretending.
   Just mouths and breath and whispered names.
   He kissed every inch of her like she was sacred.
   She clung to him like he was already fading.
   They didn’t speak after.
   They didn’t need to.
   The silence said everything.

    When she woke up, his arm was still around her.
    The sun was bleeding across the window.
    And for the first time in twelve days, she didn’t want to cross off the
calendar.
    Because that night hadn’t felt like a countdown.
    It had felt like forever.
    Even if it wasn’t.
  Chapter Thirteen: The Way You Look at
                   Me
Ava couldn’t stop touching her lips.
    Not in an obvious way.
    Just little brushes—fingertips against her mouth while reading, while
tying her shoes, while standing in front of the bathroom mirror remembering
what Noah’s kiss had felt like when it wasn’t just want or curiosity or
desperation.
    It was reverence.
    It was slow and sure and I see you.
    And now she was ruined.
    Completely, beautifully ruined for anything less than that.

   Noah texted her at noon.
   Noah:
   Lunch at your place?
   Bring leftovers. And a new version of you that doesn’t hog the blanket.
   Ava:
   You snore.
   But yes.

    He showed up with two chocolate croissants and his face still warm from
the sun. His hoodie sleeves pushed up, his hair messy, his smile too easy.
    She kissed him the second the door closed.
    Not hello.
    Not playful.
    A kiss with weight.
    One that said: I’m still here. Are you?

    They ate on the couch again, cross-legged, facing each other like high
schoolers sharing secrets instead of two adults on a deadline.
    “Do you ever think we’re doing this backwards?” she asked, halfway
through her sandwich.
    He raised a brow. “Meaning?”
     “Most people start with coffee dates and nervous flirting. We started with
thirty days and full emotional nudity.”
     He smirked. “You’re not wrong.”
     “But I like it,” she admitted.
     “I do too.”
     They sat in the quiet for a moment, the kind that had become soft instead
of sharp.
     Then he asked: “Do you regret it?”
     She didn’t answer right away.
     Put down her sandwich.
     Looked him right in the eyes.
     “No. I regret waiting this long.”
     He nodded slowly, like it physically hit him.
     “You keep looking at me like you want to say something,” she said.
     “I do.”
     “Then say it.”
     He hesitated.
     Then, quietly: “I don’t know how I’m supposed to leave.”

    It hung between them—heavy, undeniable.
    Neither moved.
    Because what do you do with a truth like that when you’ve both made
plans that don’t include staying?

     They spent the afternoon wrapped in each other’s arms.
     Not kissing.
     Not talking.
     Just breathing.
     Hands tracing lines into each other’s skin like maybe if they memorized it
all, it wouldn’t hurt so much later.

     Later that night, Ava sat in front of her journal for over an hour.
     She didn’t write anything.
     Just stared at the blank page.
     Because how do you write about someone who makes you forget your
life had pages before they arrived?
   She finally wrote one sentence:
   “The way you look at me makes me believe in things I don’t dare say out
loud.”
   And then she closed the book.
   Because that was enough for now.
Chapter Fourteen: The Kind of Love That
                Waits
Ava waited outside the coffee shop in the cold, her fingers wrapped around a
takeaway cup like it could anchor her. The leaves had started to fall, just
enough to remind everyone that time wasn’t slowing down. That endings
were real. That change was coming whether anyone was ready or not.
    She wasn't.
    Not even close.
    Noah arrived five minutes late with two things: a lopsided grin and a
bouquet of wildflowers from the corner stand.
    “They’re slightly wilted,” he said. “But I figured that fits us.”
    She took the flowers.
    Smelled them.
    “Wild and impossible?”
    He shrugged. “Still standing.”

    They walked to the bookstore where they used to sneak away during
finals week, pretending to study and always ending up on the floor in the
back, flipping through old poetry collections and arguing over who loved
Neruda more.
    Today, they sat in that same spot.
    Cross-legged. Closer than they had any right to be. Her back resting
against the shelf. His arm grazing hers every time he turned a page.
    He opened a copy of Letters to a Young Poet and read aloud.
    Not dramatically. Just enough to make her heart twist.
    “Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each
other.”
    She closed her eyes.
    Let it wash over her.

   Afterward, they grabbed hot pretzels and wandered to the overlook.
   Same bench. Same skyline. Same feeling like they were sitting on the
edge of something too big to name.
   Ava leaned into him. “I think we’re getting worse at pretending this
ends.”
   “Yeah,” he said, voice quiet. “We are.”

    They sat in that silence, wrapped in wind and the ache of something
fragile, until Noah turned toward her and asked:
    “Do you think love can wait?”
    She blinked. “What?”
    “If this... ends. If we go our separate ways. Do you think it waits for us?”
    She didn’t answer right away.
    Just looked at him.
    Really looked.
    “No,” she whispered. “I think it aches. I think it buries itself under
everything we try to build and screams until we dig it back up.”
    He laughed softly. “So... no then?”
    “I think if we leave it behind, it haunts us.”
    He nodded slowly.
    Then said the thing she wasn’t ready for:
    “I’d wait for you.”

   That night, she wrote it down in her journal:
   “He said he’d wait.
   And the terrifying part is—I believe him.”
     Chapter Fifteen: This Is What Almost
                  Feels Like
Ava’s calendar said Day Twenty-Five.
    Five days left.
    Just five.
    She stared at it like maybe it was wrong. Like if she willed it hard
enough, the numbers would reorder themselves and she could go back to the
beginning. Back to that first night on the dock. Back to before kisses and
truths and everything that felt too big to carry now.
    She was already grieving something that hadn’t ended yet.

    Noah picked her up at seven.
    Didn’t say where they were going.
    He just drove, music low, headlights carving through the dark like a
secret path only they knew.
    When she asked, he just said, “You’ll see.”

    They ended up in front of the house he grew up in.
    The one with the broken swing and the chipped paint and the little garden
she’d helped him plant once—just before his mother died.
    It was empty now.
    Abandoned.
    But still full of ghosts.
    He looked at her before they got out of the car. “I’ve never brought
anyone here.”
    Her throat tightened. “Why now?”
    “Because I need you to know where I come from. Before I go. Before you
go.”

   Inside, the air was stale but familiar.
   Ava ran her fingers over the old banister. Noah watched her like he
wasn’t sure she was real. Like he was waiting for her to disappear the
moment he blinked.
    They sat on the dusty living room floor, backs against the wall, and
talked.
    About his mom.
    About the way the silence used to scream in this house after she was
gone.
    About how Ava had been the only person who ever really filled the
silence.
    “I used to call your house from the landline and hang up after two rings,”
he admitted.
    She laughed, teary-eyed. “Why?”
    “Just to make sure you were still there.”

   The moonlight spilled through the dirty windows.
   They didn’t kiss.
   Not right away.
   They just sat there, fingers tangled, breathing each other in.
   Until Ava leaned in—slowly, carefully—and kissed him like a question.
   And he answered with both hands in her hair and every piece of himself
pressed to hers.
   They didn’t make love on the floor of that broken house.
   But they could have.
   They both knew it.
   And maybe the choice not to was the most intimate part of all.

   Driving back, Noah kept one hand on the wheel and the other in hers.
   “I keep thinking about the version of our lives where we don’t say
goodbye,” she said.
   He didn’t look at her.
   Just squeezed her hand.
   “I think about that version too.”

    That night, she lay awake in her bed, staring at the ceiling like it might
give her answers.
    She whispered the words into the dark.
    Words she hadn’t said yet.
    Not to him.
    Not even to herself.
    “I love you too much to ask you to stay.”
    Because it would’ve been too easy.
    And too unfair.
    And she wanted to be the reason he left with purpose, not the reason he
stayed with regret.
         Chapter Sixteen: Borrowed Days,
                Borrowed Hearts
They didn’t make plans the next day.
   They didn’t need to.
   Noah just showed up at her door at 10 a.m. with a backpack slung over
one shoulder and a thermos of her favorite coffee.
   “What are we doing?” Ava asked.
   He leaned against the doorframe. “Taking a day.”
   “A day?”
   “One we won’t forget. No clocks. No rules. Just you and me. Like it’s
always been.”
   She hesitated.
   Then stepped aside.
   “Okay,” she whispered. “Let’s steal a day.”

   They drove out of town with the windows down, the air sharp with the
scent of fall. He didn’t tell her where they were going, only that it would be
“quiet enough to hear everything you’re too scared to say.”
   She rolled her eyes.
   But she packed her camera.
   And a sweater that smelled like him.

   They ended up at the lake.
   The one from childhood summers.
   The one where she first learned to swim, and he first learned that girls
could punch hard when provoked.
   She smiled as the memories rolled in like waves.
   “You’re thinking about the time I shoved you off that dock,” she said.
   “You were feral that summer.”
   “You stole my towel and locked me out of the changing room.”
   He grinned. “You were kind of hot when you were furious.”
   She pushed him lightly. “I was eleven.”
   “You were dangerous.”
   They walked along the shoreline until their feet ached.
   Talked about everything and nothing.
   The jobs they almost took. The books they never finished. The version of
themselves that might’ve existed if they’d been brave sooner.
   “I think I’ve always been half in love with you,” Ava said, toes buried in
cold sand.
   He didn’t flinch.
   Didn’t tease.
   He just looked at her and said, “Same.”

    They lay on a blanket watching the clouds drift and scatter like the future
they hadn’t dared build.
    She traced the veins in his hand with her fingertip.
    “What if I told you I wanted to stay?” she asked.
    His eyes searched hers.
    “I’d say... don’t stay for me.”
    She exhaled, heart breaking and whole all at once.
    “I don’t want to lose you.”
    “You won’t,” he said. “But maybe we need to find out who we are on our
own first. So we can meet again as people who chose each other. Not just
people afraid to say goodbye.”
    Her chest cracked open.
    Because it made sense.
    Because it was right.
    And because it still hurt like hell.

   They watched the sun dip low behind the trees.
   Neither moved.
   Neither spoke.
   Until she whispered, “I think this is the best day of my life.”
   He looked at her.
   Like she was the only thing he’d ever wanted.
   Then he kissed her.
   And it wasn’t goodbye.
   Not yet.
   Just a promise.
   One they weren’t ready to break.
Chapter Seventeen: The Truth Beneath the
               Goodbye
Ava packed that night.
    Not because she wanted to.
    Because she had to.
    The job offer was waiting on her response, the plane ticket already
bought, the new apartment half-paid for in a city that felt like a dream and a
heartbreak all at once.
    She stared at her open suitcase like it might rearrange itself into a future
that didn’t hurt.

    Noah came over without knocking.
    Like always.
    Like he still belonged here.
    He stood in the doorway, watching her fold sweaters like it was a ritual
for letting go.
    “You’re really doing it,” he said.
    She nodded.
    Tried to smile.
    Failed.
    “You okay?”
    “No.”
    “Want me to go?”
    “No.”

    They sat on the floor beside the half-packed suitcase.
    Cross-legged. Knee to knee.
    Not talking.
    Not touching.
    Just being.
    Until he broke the silence.
    “I’m proud of you.”
    She looked at him.
    “You’re not mad?”
   “I’m wrecked,” he admitted. “But I’m not mad.”
   “Why not?”
   “Because you’re doing what we promised we’d always do.”
   She frowned. “What promise?”
   “To be the kind of people who don’t settle.”
   She blinked at him.
   And then she was crying.
   Not pretty tears.
   Not soft ones.
   Real, hard, aching ones.

   Noah pulled her into his chest.
   Held her through it.
   Whispered things like, “It’s okay,” and “You’re allowed,” and “God, I
love you so much.”
   She didn’t ask him to stop.
   Because she needed to hear it.
   Even if she couldn’t keep it.

    Later, they lay side by side on her bed.
    Not saying goodbye.
    Not yet.
    She stared at the ceiling, voice shaking. “What if I get there and
everything feels wrong?”
    He brushed a tear from her cheek. “Then you come back.”
    “And if I get there and everything feels right?”
    He smiled, a little sad. “Then you stay. And I cheer for you every step of
the way.”
    “You make it sound so easy.”
    “It’s not. But it’s real. And I’ll take real over easy every time.”

   She kissed him that night like she already missed him.
   And he kissed her back like he would never stop.

    When he left, he turned in the doorway, holding onto the frame like it was
the only thing keeping him standing.
    “If I asked you to stay...” he began.
She looked up.
Eyes wet.
Heart shattered.
“Don’t.”
He nodded.
“Because you’d say yes,” he whispered.
She said nothing.
And that was answer enough.
     Chapter Eighteen: The Airport Scene
Ava hated airports.
    Not because of the lines or the fluorescent lighting or the overpriced
coffee. She could live with all of that.
    She hated airports because of what they symbolized.
    A choice.
    A departure.
    A goodbye that couldn’t be undone by running back inside.
    She sat at her gate with her boarding pass in one hand and her phone in
the other, reading his last text over and over:
    Noah:
    I’m not going to ask you to stay.
    But if you look behind you, I’ll be there.
    She hadn’t looked yet.
    She was afraid she’d crumble if she did.

   She thought about the night before, the way he’d held her, the way he’d
breathed her name like it was a prayer and a curse in one.
   She thought about every version of them that could’ve been if they’d just
been a little braver a little earlier.
   But mostly, she thought about how this goodbye didn’t feel like the end.
   It felt like a comma.

   They started boarding.
   Group by group.
   Her group came up fast.
   She stood, heart racing, fingers cold around her ticket.
   The line inched forward.
   She kept her eyes on the gate.
   Refused to look back.
   Refused—
   “Ava.”
   Her whole body froze.
   That voice.
   That name.
   That tone.
   She turned.
   Slowly.
   He was there.
   Disheveled. Breathless. Like he’d run across the whole city to get to her.
   “Please don’t say goodbye like this,” he said.
   “I thought we weren’t doing goodbyes,” she whispered.
   “We’re not.”
   He stepped closer.
   “I’m just here to tell you—whatever happens, wherever you go—I’m still
yours.”
   Her eyes burned.
   Her chest cracked open.
   She reached for him, arms wrapping around his neck like memory.
   He kissed her.
   In the middle of everything.
   And she kissed him back like it was the only thing she knew how to do.

   When the gate agent called last boarding, she pulled away, breathless and
breaking.
   He tucked a note into her hand.
   “Read it on the plane.”
   She nodded.
   Walked backward toward the gate, watching him until the last possible
second.
   And then she was gone.

    On the plane, once the seatbelt light blinked on and the hum of the engine
dulled the ache in her chest, she unfolded the paper.
    It read:
    “Some people are a place.
    You’ll always be mine.
    Come home when you’re ready.
    —N”

   She cried silently into the tiny airplane pillow.
   But she smiled too.
Because maybe this wasn’t an ending.
Maybe it was a beginning.
    Chapter Nineteen: The Space Between
Two weeks later, Ava stood on the balcony of her new apartment, coffee in
hand, eyes trained on the skyline that had once lived only in dreams.
   Seattle looked exactly like the photos—gray and sprawling and moody.
The kind of city where a woman could disappear into her own ambition and
never look back.
   Except she couldn’t stop looking back.
   At her phone.
   At her calendar.
   At the memory of Noah’s face in that airport, promising he’d wait without
ever asking her to stay.

    They hadn’t spoken since she landed.
    A few texts.
    Nothing more.
    Each one polite. Gentle. Like trying to keep a bruise from blooming
further.
    She missed him so badly it felt like breathing underwater.

   She threw herself into her new life.
   The job was exciting.
   The coworkers were friendly.
   The apartment was small, but hers.
   And yet—
   She’d wake up every morning reaching for someone who wasn’t there.

    One night, after a long day filled with nothing in particular, she found the
note again.
    Tucked into her journal.
    “Some people are a place.
    You’ll always be mine.
    Come home when you’re ready.”

   She sat down and wrote him a letter.
   Longhand.
    No typing. No erasing.
    Just truth.
    Dear Noah,
    This place is beautiful.
    The kind of beautiful you want to photograph, not live inside.
    I think about you every time it rains.
    Which is... always.
    I haven’t kissed anyone.
    Haven’t even tried.
    I don’t want someone new.
    I want you.
    But I also want to become the kind of person who doesn’t need to be
rescued.
    Who doesn’t forget herself in the comfort of someone else.
    I’m not ready to come home yet.
    But I will.
    And when I do—I hope you still look at me the way you did that last
night.
    Yours, always,
    Ava

   She didn’t send it.
   Not yet.
   Some things need time to ripen.
   Like courage.
   Like clarity.
   Like love.

   She put the letter in her nightstand drawer.
   Next to the note he gave her.
   And whispered into the dark, “We’re not finished.”

   Because love like theirs didn’t end.
   It waited.
   And maybe that was the bravest part of all.
             Chapter Twenty: Full Circle
Three months later, Ava came home.
   Not forever.
   Not yet.
   Just for the weekend.
   A friend's wedding, a quick visit with her dad, a whirlwind few days of
familiar streets and faces that hadn't changed much since she left.
   But when her plane touched down, the first name in her head wasn’t
family.
   It was Noah.

    She didn’t text him.
    Didn’t call.
    She just showed up—on instinct and hope—at the dock where it had all
started.
    The place they’d made the pact.
    The place where almost had first become everything.
    The water was still. The air warm for autumn. Golden hour bleeding
across the lake like a painting too perfect to be real.
    And then—
    There he was.
    Sitting on the edge, legs swinging over the water, a thermos by his side
and a look in his eyes like he knew she’d come back.

   “You always did have good timing,” he said, not turning around.
   She stepped closer. “You always did wait for me.”
   Now he turned.
   And when he saw her, he smiled like a man coming home.

    They didn’t run to each other.
    Didn’t speak right away.
    Just stood in the quiet and looked—like seeing each other for the first
time again.
    Older.
    Stronger.
Still impossibly in love.

She sat beside him.
Their arms brushed.
Neither pulled away.
“I wrote you a letter,” she said.
“Yeah?”
“Didn’t send it.”
“Figures.”
She smirked. “You still keeping count of our almosts?”
He looked at her then.
Really looked.
“I stopped counting the day you left.”
“Why?”
“Because I didn’t want another almost.”

The wind picked up.
She closed her eyes.
Inhaled.
Exhaled.
Then opened them, turned to him fully, and whispered:
“Noah, I’m still in love with you.”
His breath hitched.
“Still?”
“Always.”
He reached for her hand.
She let him.
“Say it again.”
She leaned in, forehead against his, lips just a breath away.
“I love you.”
And this time, there was no almost.
There was only yes.

They kissed with everything they’d been holding back.
With every second they’d spent apart.
With the promise that this—finally, truly, fully—was real.
No time limits.
No pacts.
No borrowed days.
Just love.
The kind that waits.
The kind that chooses.
To be continued...
